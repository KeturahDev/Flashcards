# Flashcards
By Keturah Howard and Sommer T

## Description
This application shows you the definitions of the termonology learned in class at Epicodus. When you click on one vocabulary word, the definition that was previously opened will close. Test your knowledge, and predict what the definitions will say before you reveal them! The intention of writing this code is to practice hiding and revealing hidden elements from the DOM using jQuery functions.

## Set Up
1. Open gh-pages [here!](https://keturahdev.github.io/Flashcards/)
2. Or, clone, open code with 'code .' after changing into project directory, and view the page by typing in the terminal 'open index.html'

## Technologies Used
* jQuery
* Bootstrap version 3.3.7
* Javascript
* CSS
* Visual Studio Code
